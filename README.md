## Adding a New Slide

1. Create a new `.html` file in `slides/` (use an existing deck as a template).
2. Push to `main` - the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically update this README and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

Open any slide file directly in your browser:

```sh
open slides/playwright-cli.html
```
